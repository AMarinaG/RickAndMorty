# Rick And Morty

## Summary

After a hard day of filming, the actors of the Rick and Morty series like to meet at the port bar
closest space and relax drinking beer and remembering stories. But recently a strange virus has
spread through the universe and the Council of Ricks has imposed a series of restrictions that only
allows social gatherings of two people. For this reason, they have asked us to develop an app that
the actors of the series can download on their phones and allow them to find the most compatible
beer buddy. To obtain all the necessary data, the public API will be
used: [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
